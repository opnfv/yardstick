The IP addresses are different.\n3. vFW \u0026 vACL VNF create/apply default actions/rules first and then apply rules from the configuration file. The raw SampleVNF CLI commands of vFW can be found at http://paste.openstack.org/show/723304/. The vFW have conntrack action by default, the vACL doesn\u0027t ( see http://paste.openstack.org/show/723303/).",
