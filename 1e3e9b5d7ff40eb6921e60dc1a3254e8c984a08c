      "message": "I think the the arguments to the scenarios also needs refactoring. It is very confusing as it is now. \n\nThe context argument in the __init__ method is named badly as it always contains the \u0027runner_cfg\u0027 dict. \n\nThe args argument in the run method contain the \u0027scenario_cfg\u0027 dictionary which includes the \u0027runner_cfg\u0027 dict. \n\nAs we have overlap in the data passed to the two methods I propose we use scenario_cfg at construction and remove args from the run method.",
