  vBNG RFC2544 test case with QoS base line with link congestion.
  Test case creates PPPoE sessions, runs traffic from two core ports
  to one access port causing congestion of that port (traffic from
  other access ports are splitting between remaining core ports)
  and measures packets drop rate on all ports for each priority flow.
