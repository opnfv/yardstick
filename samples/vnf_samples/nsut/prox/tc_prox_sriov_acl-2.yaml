description: >
        This test allows to measure how well the SUT can exploit structures in the list of ACL rules. The KPI is the number of packets per second for a specified packet size with an accepted minimal packet loss.

scenarios:
-
  type: NSPerf
  #
  # In case where we know that all the packets generated by the generator
  # will bw received. Then use prox_binsearch.
  #
  # In the case where some or all the packets generated by the generator may
  # not be received. Please use prox_acl .. (This generates packets at
  # a specific rate and does not change rate.
