        This test queries the PROX IRQ Statistics on the GEN and VNF. The KPIs
        returned are the Maximium IRQ per core and the IRQs per second per
        core.

scenarios:
-
  type: NSPerf
  traffic_profile: ../../traffic_profiles/prox_irq.yaml
  topology: prox-tg-topology-0.yaml

  nodes:
    tg__0: trafficgen_0.yardstick
    vnf__0: vnf_0.yardstick

  options:
    vnf__0:
      prox_path: /opt/nsb_bin/prox
      prox_config: "configs/irq2.cfg"
      prox_args:
        "-t": ""
    tg__0:

  runner:
    type: ProxDuration
    # sampling interval
    interval: 1
    # sampled : yes OR sampled: no (DEFAULT yes)
    sampled: yes
    # we kill after duration, independent of test duration, so set this high
    duration: 8000
    # Confirmation attempts
    confirmation: 1
