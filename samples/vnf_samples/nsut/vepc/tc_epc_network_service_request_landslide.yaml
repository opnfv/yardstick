    Downlink Data Notification from Network to UE that are in Idle state.

      # Configurations:
      # 1. Specify continuous periodical events: UE goes to Idle state -> DL Data Notification
      # E.g. Set Gtp2IdleEntryTime = 5 - UE goes to idle state after 5 seconds
      #      Set transactionRate = 0.1 - Send traffic periodically every 10 seconds
      # 2. Set traffic run start delay
      # E.g. Set Gtp2IdleEntryTime = 5 - UE goes to idle state after 5 seconds
      #      Set TrafficStartDelay with value greater that Gtp2IdleEntryTime
      Gtp2IdleEntryTime: '5' # Idle Entry Time (s)

      # Downlink Data Notification settings
      TrafficStartDelay: 1000 # Data Start Delay (ms)
