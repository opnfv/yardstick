description: >
    DUT1 and DUT2 are configured with DPDK HW cryptodev devices
    and {{ tunnels }} IPsec tunnels between them. DUTs get IPv4 traffic from TG
    with IMIX packet size and number of flows is {{ flow_count }}, encrypt it
    and send to another DUT, where packets are decrypted and sent back to TG.
    Measure successful transmit rate, throughput NDR/PDR with MLR search
    is {{ "enabled" if mlr_search else "disabled" }}, latency.
