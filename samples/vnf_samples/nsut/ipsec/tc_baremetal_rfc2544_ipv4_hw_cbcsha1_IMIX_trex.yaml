description: >
    This is the VPP IPSec performance tests based on the Data Plane Development
    Kit (DPDK) Cryptodev framework. DUT1 and DUT2 are configured with DPDK HW
    cryptodev devices and {{ tunnels }} IPsec tunnels between them. DUTs get
    IPv4 traffic from TG with IMIX packet size and number of flows is
    {{ flow_count }}, encrypt it and send to another DUT, where packets are
    decrypted and sent back to TG. Measure successful transmit rate, throughput
    NDR/PDR with MLR search is {{ "enabled" if mlr_search else "disabled" }}, latency.
