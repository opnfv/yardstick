      "message": "These are caused by upstream changes.\nUp to and including the D release, Fuel@OPNFV was built on top of Fuel@Openstack, which used an in-house solution to build Ubuntu images and write them on the nodes, hardcoding the \u0027root\u0027/\u0027r00tme\u0027 user/pass combination in the process.\nStarting with the E release, Fuel@OPNFV relies on Salt to handle the deployment, which leverages MaaS baremetal provisioner and configures node access on the default user created by MaaS (\u0027ubuntu\u0027) using a keypair (mcp.rsa below).\nThe user \u0027ubuntu\u0027 won\u0027t change from deployment to deployment. The key path can be anything really, as long as we properly document this, and let the end-users know where the key is located and how it is named.\nI agree a `username`/`key_file` implementation would be better and allow more flexibility.",

      "message": "If the key file location can vary between deployments (i.e. it\u0027s configurable), then we should not hard code it here.\n\nAdditionally, if this is configurable, we can use the same pod.yaml for other OPNFV installers, not just fuel.\n\nAlong with other, similar changes, this could contribute to the reduction in the size of the yardstick container running on a system.",
