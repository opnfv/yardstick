      "message": "Hmm yeah you are right. I am trying to find an effective way to kill the most significant ODL node in the cluster for my testcase so I can observe how different things behave when the the most important ODL node is down. I think the member-0 is the most important ODL node. Maybe it is not the Leader of the cluster all the time but this is something we cannot determine because IMHO different module-shards can have different Leaders. So How are we gonna take a decision of which ODL is the most significant if the different module-shards have different leaders.\n\nSo I thought that to kill the member-0 ODL it would be a compromise that could work for the testcase.\n\nWhat do you think? Can you please tell me your opinion on that?\nIf you have anything to propose please do.",
