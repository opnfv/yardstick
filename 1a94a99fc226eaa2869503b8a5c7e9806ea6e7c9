      "message": "I think this way of cloning is not very good from security perspective as you are essentially giving away your username/password combination. Whoever reads this build file can now read/write/delete this repository and any other repositories you have under your Bitbucket account even if they are private.\n\nI suggest you take a look at Bitbucket\u0027s access tokens, with the help of refresh tokens. This way you are not giving away your password and control over your repositories. Link to documentation:\nhttps://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud-238027431.html\n\nThis way the clone command becomes something like this:\n\n  $ git clone https://x-token-auth:{access_token}@bitbucket.org/akiskourtis/vtc.git",
