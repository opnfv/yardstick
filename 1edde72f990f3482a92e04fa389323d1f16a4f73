If #1 is yes, then if the \"key_filename\" is set to non existed file name, it will be generated by L356 anyway and have generated key instead of provided one which may cause the issue during connection to the VM. It will be hard to determine why the connection problem to VM exists.",

      "message": "Sorry for late reply.\nThank you for your comment. \nI think the flow is just simple. In deploy() function, we has two cases:\nFirst case, using internal key is generate by yardstick ( by default yardstick flow).\nSecond case, using external key is provided by user.\n\nFor your two questions:\n1. Yes, this function is called after deploy() function.\n2. This is the first case, if the \"key_filename\" does not exist, it will raise the error, and does not generate the key by L356. Because L356 just generates the key in deploy() function before.",
