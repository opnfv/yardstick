      "message": "Would be useful to also include the \u0027time\u0027 for the SDN Controller to reset, initialize and re-sync with open stack compute vSwitches, such that it is ready to support any new network service operations from the openstack controller.\n\nBecause when the SDN Controller is reseting, the system is exposed to a subsequent fault causing a full outage.  I.e. if a compute node fails, while the SDN Controller is resetting, and NOVA recovers the impacted VMs on an alternate compute node, there will be no ability for Neutron (via SDN Controller northbound interfaces) to recover the networking for these VMs.",
