      "message": "For the requirement \" In case a Duration runner is used, the duration (time) should be as specified in the input task file.\"\n\nCheck the iperf3 scenario, it checks if run by a Duration runner and uses that duration time. Yes this is a bit ugly but is what we have right now.\n\nPlease add the same to this scenario so that the above requirement gets satisfied.\n\nActually it is only a step_duration if run by the Arithmetic runner, better call it just duration.",
