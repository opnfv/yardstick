I think we should check if effective user is root before running apt-get. Or we could add  python-lxml to install dependencies in README and remove apt-get.",

      "message": "yes,\"/tmp/{pyang.parser}\" is better. thank you so much.\nAbout installation of \"python-lxml \" , i\u0027m a little confused, if i add it to readme and remove apt-get, how to make it run successfully in docker container when it is trigger by jenkins, Do i need to add \"python-lxml\" to dockerfile?\nor just check if user is root permission or not and don\u0027t remove apt-get,so non root permission user can\u0027t run this scenario\ncould you give me some suggestion",

      "message": "thank you for your good suggestion, do you mean put installation of \"python-lxml\" into install_requires list in setup.py?  for my limited understanding, this install equal \"pip install python-lxml\", it need libxml2 and libxslt package. however, libxml2 and libxslt cann\u0027t be installed by pip. so we still need to use \"apt-get\" to install \"libxml2 and libxslt\", then non root user still will fail.",
