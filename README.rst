Yardstick
=========


Overview
--------

Yardstick is a framework to test non functional characteristics of an NFV
Infrastructure as perceived by an application.

An application is a set of virtual machines deployed using the orchestrator of
the target cloud, for example OpenStack Heat.

Yardstick measures a certain service performance but can also validate the
service performance to be within a certain level of agreement.

Architecture
------------

Yardstick is a command line tool written in python inspired by Rally. Yardstick
is intended to run on a computer with access and credentials to a cloud. The
test case is described in a configuration file given as an argument.

How it works: the benchmark task configuration file is parsed and converted into
an internal model. The context part of the model is converted into a Heat
template and deployed into a stack. Each scenario is run using a runner, either
serially or in parallel. Each runner runs in its own subprocess executing
commands in a VM using SSH. The output of each command is written as json
records to a file.

Installation
------------

Yardstick supports installation on Ubuntu 14.04, OpenSUSE Leap 42.2, 42.3 and
Tumbleweed or via a Docker image.
