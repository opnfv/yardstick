      "message": "Yes, we need to redefine the \"run_test\"\n\nThe test cases are taken from DATS. The previous implementation had a separate class for each test and each test had a separate file.\nEg:\nl2fwd: class ForwardPacketsNoTouch(dats.test.binsearch.BinarySearch):\nMPLS : class MplsTagUntag(dats.test.binsearch.BinarySearch):\n\nHowever, most of the test cases uses the same approach to run tests with different configs.\nFor eg: l2fwd, l2fwd_pkt_touch, acl can use the run_test (generic)\n\nBut there are some tests which run a bit different, like MPLS, bng, etc. They need extra parameter from the config before starting a test. For Eg: \nMpls need to know which cores are tagged and which are plain and set the speed and pkt_size based on that.\n\nThings get a bit more complicated when we move forward to complex tests like BNG, BNG-QoS, vPE.\nFor Eg: BNG does the follwing-\nclass BNG(dats.test.binsearch.BinarySearch): \n\tsetup_class() : gets info from cfg regarding cores/tasks: CPE, INET, ARP, ARP_TASK\n\tsetup_test()  : Sets the packet size and speed \n\trun_test()    : Gets the stats and calculate packet loss.\n\nThis makes it difficult to use the existing run_test.",
