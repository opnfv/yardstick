# VSPERF specific configuration file for execution of RFC2544 throughput
# traffic. Traffic executed by traffic generator is forwarded directly
# between interfaces connected to the traffic generator. So test will only
# benchmark the performance of OVS external bridge at controller node.
# Details about supported test options and test case execution can be
# found in VSPERF documentation:
