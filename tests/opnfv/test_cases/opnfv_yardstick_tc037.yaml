    Yardstick TC037 config file;
    Measure network throughput and packet loss using pktgen;
    Different amounts of flows are tested with, from 2 up to 1001000;
    All tests are run 2 times each. First 2 times with the least
    amount of ports, then 2 times with the next amount of ports,
    and so on until all packet sizes have been run with;
    During the measurements system load and network latency are
    recorded/measured using ping and mpstat, respectively;

{% set provider = provider or none %}
{% set physical_network = physical_network or 'physnet1' %}
{% set segmentation_id = segmentation_id or none %}
