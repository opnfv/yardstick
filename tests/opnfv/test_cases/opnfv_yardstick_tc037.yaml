# Yardstick TC037 config file
# Measure network throughput and packet loss using pktgen.
# Different amounts of flows are tested with, from 2 up to 1001000.
# All tests are run 2 times each. First 2 times with the least
# amount of ports, then 2 times with the next amount of ports,
# and so on until all packet sizes have been run with.
#
# During the measurements system load and network latency are
# recorded/measured using ping and mpstat, respectively.
