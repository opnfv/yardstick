    Yardstick TC008 config file;
    Measure network throughput and packet loss using testpmd and pktgen-dpdk;
    Different amount of flows, from 2 up to 1001000, in combination
    with different packet sizes are run in each test.
    Each combination of packet size and flow amount is run 10 times.
    First 10 times with the smallest packet size, starting with the
    least amount of ports/flows, then next amount of ports with same
    packet size, and so on. The test sequence continues with the next
    packet size, with same ports/flows sequence as before.

scenarios:
{% for pkt_size in [64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1280, 1518] %}
  {% for num_ports in [1, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000] %}
