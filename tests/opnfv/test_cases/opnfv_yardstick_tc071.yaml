# Yardstick TC071 config file
# Measure cache hit/miss ratio and usage, network throughput and latency.
# Different amounts of flows are tested with, from 2 up to 1001000.
# All tests are run 2 times each. First 2 times with the least
# amount of ports, then 2 times with the next amount of ports,
# and so on until all packet sizes have been run with.
#
# During the measurements cache hit/miss ration, cache usage statistics and
# network latency are recorded/measured using cachestat and ping, respectively.
