# Yardstick TC009 config file
# Measure network throughput and packet loss using pktgen.
# Different amounts of flows are tested with, from 2 up to 1001000.
# All tests are run 10 times each. First 10 times with the least
# amount of ports, then 10 times with the next amount of ports,
# and so on until all packet sizes have been run with.
