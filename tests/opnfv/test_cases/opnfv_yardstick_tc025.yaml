    Sample test case for the HA of OpenStack Controll Node abnormally shutdown.
    In order to power on the shutdown node after testing, the jumphost is
    required to install ipmitool. Ipmi jumphost info and each nodes' ipmi ip,
    username, password are needed in pod file (There is a sample pod file in
    "etc/yardstick/nodes/pod.yaml.ipmi.sample").

{% set pod = pod or 'etc/yardstick/nodes/fuel_virtual/pod.yaml' %}
{% set jumphost = jumphost or 'node0' %}
