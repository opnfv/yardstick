# VSPERF specific configuration file for execution of continuous traffic.
# Traffic executed by traffic generator is forwarded directly between
# interfaces connected to the traffic generator. So test will only
# benchmark the performance of OVS external bridge at controller node.
# For details about supported test options see following file from
