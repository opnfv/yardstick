In this case, this will happen in L266.\n\n\nfor network in networks:\n    ports \u003d [list(port.keys())[0] for port in ports.get(network.name, [])\n    for port in ports:\n        if port.startswith(\u0027-\u0027):\n             LOG.warning(\"possible YAML error, port name starts with - \u0027%s\", port)\n\nWith these code L279-L281 and L264-L274 are not needed.\n\n\nBTW, in L271 \"ports\" is always a list, so this check is irrelevant, unless a network port could defined both as a list or just one dict element.",
