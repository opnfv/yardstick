If you can\u0027t retrieve the dropped packets then that should be relayed as that. not try to compensate with a calculation that isn\u0027t a fair representation of packets dropped.\n\nI believe from the documentation you should be able to get the real dropped packet stats from the DPDK stats/xstats APIs:\nhttps://01.org/intel-data-plane-performance-demonstrators/documentation/prox-documentation\n\nYou should try to get the real dropped counters from the relevant ports and add them up.",
