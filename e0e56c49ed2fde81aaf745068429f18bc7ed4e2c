      "message": "1) We are using \"-\" to assign the host name plus the task ID to the VMs [1]. Using the same separator is a bad idea. Instead of this use underscore.\n2) There is a function in base.Context, \"split_name\", to do this operation. If you need something different in kubernetes, override the parent function.\n3) Provide a method in base.Context and kubernetes.KubernetesContext to do just the opposite: to format the name (what you are doing in L634)\n4) Testing: all those functions must be tested, just in case, as I said in point 1, to check that the name-taskid separator doesn\u0027t collide with the qualified name separator.\n\n[1]https://github.com/opnfv/yardstick/blob/master/yardstick/benchmark/contexts/base.py#L65\n[2]https://github.com/opnfv/yardstick/blob/master/yardstick/benchmark/contexts/base.py#L46",
