This \u0027host\u0027 and \u0027target\u0027 stanzas are maybe a bit limited in the general case.\n\nSome scenarios may need a list of nodes in order to perform their tests. E.g. one scenario may need 3 controllers and another scenario maybe needs four random nodes of a specific type.  Do we want/need to be able to express that in yaml?\n\nOr should we allow the scenarios to grab whatever nodes there are in the Node context? An api is maybe needed? \n\nAn do we see a need to support multicontext scenarios (e.g. a scenarios that need both Node and Heat contexts) ?",
