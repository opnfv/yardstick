For instance, to understand potential generator related issues.\nIf the Generator runs on top of OVS, we might want to view of the OVS DPDK stats in case packets were lost between the GEN and the SUT...\nShould we not keep them, so that there are stored in the db - There would not be shown by default in grafana or html report.",

Created this patch as there was a discussion that how PROX as a traffic gen is different from other traffic gens in NSB.\n  \nIn other traffic generators(HW-Ixia or SW_T-rex) we don\u0027t collect NFVI metrics. Probably they have there own collection methods, but we don\u0027t explicitly collect in NSB using collectd.",
