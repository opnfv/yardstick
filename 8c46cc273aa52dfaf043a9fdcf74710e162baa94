      "message": "I wonder if it is a good idea to move scenario_cfg[\"ipaddr\"] (from below) to the runner_cfg[\u0027target\u0027] dictionary? It makes more sense to me too keep them all in the same place. And maybe also always include target.private_ip in the dictionary?\n\nE.g.\n    runner_cfg[\u0027target\u0027][\u0027private_ip\u0027] \u003d target.private_ip\n    runner_cfg[\u0027target\u0027][\u0027public_ip\u0027] \u003d target.public_ip (if exist)\n    runner_cfg[\u0027target\u0027][\u0027ip\u0027] \u003d public_ip OR private_ip (old ipaddr)\n\nNot neccessary to do it in this patch, but I think some improvements could be done here.",
