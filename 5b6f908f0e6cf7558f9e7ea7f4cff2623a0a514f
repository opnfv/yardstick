The key_filename should work with auto-generated template too.",

      "message": "Again, if user provided template file in TC and provided incorrect key_filename path (e.g. key_filename: yardstick/resources/files/key-blabla), the Yardstick will generate automatically SSH key using the provided key file name and use it by heat. The logic above will not catch that (since the incorrect key file provided by user will be generate automatically anyway by Yardstick). This behavior is not obvious for user, thus it should be fixed.\nThe correct logic of you changes should be the following:\nIf user provided incorrect key file name, the Yardstick should stop running the TC and print an error as above. This doesn\u0027t work like that at the moment.",
