      "message": "What about adding the following here?\n\nThe ``yardstick report generate`` command creates a compact HTML report. This layout is suitable for test cases producing a few metrics over a short period of time. All metrics for all timestamps are displayed in the data table and on the graph.\n\nThe ``yardstick report generate-nsb`` command creates a dynamic HTML report consisting of a wider data table, a graph, and a tree that allows selecting the metrics to be displayed. This layout is suitable for test cases, such as NSB ones, producing a lot of metrics over a longer period of time.",
