- name: Add go language gophers repo key
  # due to a proxy issue in the ansible apt_key module on Ubuntu 17.10,
  # it doesn't work to add key via `id` and `keyserver` parametes. Similar
  # issue is described here: https://github.com/debops/ansible-elastic_co/issues/2
  #  apt_key:
  #    keyserver: "{{ golang_repo_key_server }}"
  #    id: "{{ golang_repo_key_id }}"
  # As a workaround, we can use `apt-key` tool directly with proxy specified.
  command: >
           apt-key adv --keyserver {{ golang_repo_key_server }} --recv-keys
           --keyserver-options http-proxy={{ proxy_env.http_proxy }}
           {{ golang_repo_key_id }}
