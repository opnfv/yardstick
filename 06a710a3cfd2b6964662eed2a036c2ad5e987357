      "message": "Yardstick uses two VM images for it\u0027s tests: One based on cirros and one ubuntu-server. \n\nIf you are debugging a connectivity issue (ie you cannot ssh to the image) with a yardstick test that uses the cirros image you can log in to the VM via it\u0027s console by using the Horizon gui. However by default the ubuntu-server image does not allow any password based log in, even on the console - therefore you cannot debug any connectivity issues from the VM side.\n\nThis patch allows console log in to an ubuntu-server based VM just as can be done for the cirros based VMs.",
