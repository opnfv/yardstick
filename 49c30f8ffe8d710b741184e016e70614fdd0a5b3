      "message": "In my opinion, the test tool is \"yardstick + opnfv_yardstick_tc019.yaml\", because if you want to test this case, you must run the command \"yardstick task start opnfv_yardstick_tc019.yaml\", then yardstick will run this scenario for testing controller service HA. So yes, all of different services can be tested by using this common test tool, if you want to test another service, like cinder-api, you will modify a parameter called \"process_name\" in opnfv_yardstick_tc019.yaml and run the command again.",
