Yardstick_ is an OPNFV Project.

The project's goal is to verify infrastructure compliance, from the perspective
of a :term:`VNF`.

The Project's scope is the development of a test framework, *Yardstick*, test
cases and test stimuli to enable :term:`NFVI` verification.
The Project also includes a sample :term:`VNF`, the :term:`VTC`  and its
experimental framework, *ApexLake* !

The chapter :doc:`02-methodology` describes the methodology implemented by the
Yardstick Project for :term:`NFVI` verification. The chapter
:doc:`03-list-of-tcs` includes a list of available Yardstick test cases.

Yardstick is used for verifying the OPNFV infrastructure and some of the OPNFV
features, listed in :doc:`03-list-of-tcs`.

The *Yardstick* framework is deployed in several  OPNFV community labs. It is
installer, infrastructure and application independent.
