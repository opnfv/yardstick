|test purpose  | Measure the memory read latency for varying memory sizes and |
|              | strides. Whole memory hierarchy is measured including all    |
|              | levels of cache.                                             |

|              | * Interval: 1 - there is 1 second delay between each         |
|              |   iteration.                                                 |

|              | Lmbench is a suite of operating system microbenchmarks. This |
|              | test uses lat_mem_rd tool from that suite.                   |
|              | Lmbench is not always part of a Linux distribution, hence it |
|              | needs to be installed in the test image                      |

|step 1        | The host is installed as client. Lmbench's lat_mem_rd tool   |
