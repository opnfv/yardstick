|applicability | Test can be configured with different flavors, vNIC type     |
|              | and packet sizes. Default values exist as specified above.   |
|              | The vNIC type and flavor MUST be specified by the user.      |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|pre-test      | The vTC has been successfully instantiated and configured.   |
|              | The user has correctly assigned the values to the deployment |
|              |  configuration parameters.                                   |
|              |                                                              |
|              | - Multicast traffic MUST be enabled on the network.          |
|              |      The Data network switches need to be configured in      |
|              |      order to manage multicast traffic.                      |
|              | - In the case of SR-IOV vNICs use, SR-IOV compatible NICs    |
|              |      must be used on the compute node.                       |
|              | - Yarsdtick needs to be installed on a host connected to the |
|              |      data network and the host must have 2 DPDK-compatible   |
|              |      NICs. Proper configuration of DPDK and DPDK pktgen is   |
|              |      required before to run the test case.                   |
|              |      (For further instructions please refer to the ApexLake  |
|              |      documentation).                                         |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|step  1       | The vTC is deployed, according to the user-defined           |
|              | configuration                                                |

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step  2       | The vTC is correctly deployed and configured as necessary    |
|              | The initialization script has been correctly executed and    |
|              | vTC is ready to receive and process the traffic.             |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step  3       | Test case is executed with the selected parameters:          |
|              | - vTC flavor                                                 |
|              | - vNIC type                                                  |
|              | - packet size                                                |
|              | The traffic is sent to the vTC using the maximum available   |
|              | traffic rate for 60 seconds.                                 |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 4        | The vTC instance forwards all the packets back to the packet |
|              | generator for 60 seconds, as specified by RFC 2544.          |
|              |                                                              |
|              | Steps 3 and 4 are executed different times, with different   |
|              | rates in order to find the maximum supported traffic rate    |
|              | according to the current definition of throughput in RFC     |
|              | 2544.                                                        |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test verdict  |  The result of the test is a number between 0 and 100 which  |
|              |  represents the throughput in terms of percentage of the     |
|              |  available pktgen NIC bandwidth.                             |
|              |                                                              |
