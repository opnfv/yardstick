|OpenStack Controll Node abnormally shutdown High Availability                |
+==============+==============================================================+
|test case id  | OPNFV_YARDSTICK_TC025_HA: OpenStack Controll Node abnormally |
|              | shutdown                                                     |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test purpose  | This test case will verify the high availability of control  |
|              | nodethe. When one of the control node abnormally shutdown,   |
|              | the service provided by it should be OK.                     |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test method   | This test case shutdowns a specified control node with some  |
|              | fault injection tools, then checks whether all services      |
|              | provided by the control node are OK with some monitor tools. |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|attackers     | In this test case, an attacker called "host-shutdown" is     |
|              | needed. This attacker includes two parameters:               |
|              | 1) fault_type: which is used for finding the attacker's      |
|              | scripts. It should be always set to "host-shutdown" in       |
|              | this test case.                                              |
|              | 2) host: which is the name of a control node being attacked. |
|              |                                                              |
|              | e.g.                                                         |
|              | -fault_type: "host-shutdown"                                 |
|              | -host: node1                                                 |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|monitors      | In this test case, one kind of monitor are needed:           |
|              | 1. the "openstack-cmd" monitor constantly request a specific |
|              |    Openstack command, which needs two parameters:            |
|              | 1) monitor_type: which is used for finding the monitor class |
|              | and related scritps. It should be always set to              |
|              | "openstack-cmd" for this monitor.                            |
|              | 2) command_name: which is the command name used for request  |
|              |                                                              |
|              | There are four instance of the "openstack-cmd" monitor:      |
|              | monitor1:                                                    |
|              | -monitor_type: "openstack-cmd"                               |
|              | -api_name: "nova image-list"                                 |
|              | monitor2:                                                    |
|              | -monitor_type: "openstack-cmd"                               |
|              | -api_name: "neutron router-list"                             |
|              | monitor3:                                                    |
|              | -monitor_type: "openstack-cmd"                               |
|              | -api_name: "heat stack-list"                                 |
|              | monitor4:                                                    |
|              | -monitor_type: "openstack-cmd"                               |
|              | -api_name: "cinder list"                                     |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|metrics       | In this test case, there is one metric:                      |
|              | 1)service_outage_time: which indicates the maximum outage    |
|              | time (seconds) of the specified Openstack command request.   |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test tool     | None. Self-developed.                                        |

|configuration | This test case needs two configuration files:                |
|              | 1) test case file: opnfv_yardstick_tc019.yaml                |

|              | The POD configuration should record on pod.yaml first.       |
|              | the "host" item in this test case will use the node name in  |
|              | the pod.yaml.                                                |
