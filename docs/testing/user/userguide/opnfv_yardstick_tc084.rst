|SDN Controller resilience in non-HA configuration                            |
|                                                                             |

|test case id  | OPNFV_YARDSTICK_TC084: SDN controller resilience in          |
|              | non-HA configuration                                         |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test purpose  | This test validates SDN controller node high availability by |
|              | verifying there is no impact on the data plane connectivity  |
|              | when a SDN controller is shutdown in non-HA configuration.   |
|              | i.e. all existing configured network services DHCP, ARP, L2, |
|              | L3, SNAT Security Groups should continue to operate          |
|              | between the existing VMs while SDN controller is rebooting.  |
|              | The test also validates the new network service operations   |
|              | (creating a new VM in the existing L2/L3 network or in a new |
|              | network...etc) are operational after the SDN controller      |
|              | recovers from the failure                                    |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test method   | This test case shutsdown the SDN controller service running  |
|              | on the OpenStack controller node, then checks if already     |
|              | configured DHCP/ARP/L2/L3/SNAT connectivity is not           |
|              | impacted in the existing VMs and system is able to execute   |
|              | new virtual network operations once the opendaylight service |
|              | is fully recovered                                           |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|attackers     | In this test case, an attacker called “kill-process” is      |
|              | needed.This attacker includes three parameters:              |
|              |  1. fault_type: which is used for finding the attacker’s     |
|              |     scripts. It should be set to 'kill-process' in this test |
|              |                                                              |
|              |  2. process_name: should be set to sdn controller process    |
|              |                                                              |
|              |  3. host: which is the name of a control node where          |
|              |     opendaylight process is running                          |
|              |                                                              |
|              | e.g. -fault_type: “kill-process”                             |
|              |      -process_name: “opendaylight-karaf” (TBD)               |

|              |  2. One or more neutron networks are created with two or     |
|              |     more VMs attached to each of the neutron networks.       |
|              |                                                              |
|              |  3. The neutron networks are attached to a neutron router    |
|              |     which is attached to anexternal network towards the      |
|              |     DCGW.                                                    |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 1        | Start IP connectivity monitors:                              |
|              |  1. Check the L2 connectivity between the VMs in the same    |
|              |     neutron network.                                         |

|              |     neutron networks attached to neutron router.             |
|              |                                                              |
|              |  3. Check the SNAT connectivity from the VMs.                |
|              |     each monitor will run with independently process         |
|              |                                                              |
|              | Result: The monitor info will be collected.                  |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 2        | Determine the VIM controller node on which sdn controller    |
|              | service is running                                           |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 3        | Start attacker:                                              |
|              | SSH connect to the VIM node and kill sdn controller process  |
|              |                                                              |
|              | Result: the sdn controller service will be shutdown          |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 4        | Stop IP connectivity monitors after a period of time         |
|              | specified by “waiting_time”                                  |
|              |                                                              |
|              | Result: The monitor info will be aggregated                  |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 5        | Verify the IP connectivity monitor result                    |
|              |                                                              |
|              | Result: IP connectivity monitor should not have any packet   |
|              | drop failures reported                                       |

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 6        | Verify process_recover_time, which indicates the maximun     |
|              | time (seconds) from the process being killed to recovered,   |
|              | is within the SLA. This step blocks until either the SDN     |
|              | controller process has recovered or a timeout occurred.      |
|              |                                                              |
|              | Result: process_recover_time is within SLA limits, if not,   |
|              | test case failed and stopped                                 |
|              |                                                              |

|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 8        | Start IP connectivity monitors from new VM:                  |
|              | 1. Check the L2 connectivity from the new VM to other VMs    |
|              |    in the neutron network.                                   |
|              |                                                              |

|              |                                                              |
|              | 3. Check the SNAT connectivity from the new VM to            |
|              |    external network.                                         |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
