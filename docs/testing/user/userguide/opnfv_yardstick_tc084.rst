|test purpose  | The purpose of TC084 is to evaluate the IaaS compute         |
|              | performance by using SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark. The SPEC CPU   |
|              | 2006 benchmark has several different ways to measure         |
|              | computer performance. One way is to measure how fast the     |
|              | computer completes a single task; this is called a speed     |
|              | measurement. Another way is to measure how many tasks        |
|              | computer can accomplish in a certain amount of time; this is |
|              | called a throughput, capacity or rate measurement.           |
|              |                                                              |

|              |                                                              |
|              | The SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark is SPEC's industry-standardized, |
|              | CPU-intensive benchmark suite, stressing a system's          |
|              | processor, memory subsystem and compiler. This benchmark     |
|              | suite includes the SPECint benchmarks and the SPECfp         |
|              | benchmarks. The SPECint 2006 benchmark contains 12 different |
|              | benchmark tests and the SPECfp 2006 benchmark contains 19    |
|              | different benchmark tests.                                   |
|              |                                                              |
|              | SPEC CPU 2006 is not always part of a Linux distribution.    |
|              | SPEC requires that users purchase a license and agree with   |
|              | their terms and conditions. For this test case, users must   |
|              | manually download cpu2006-1.2.iso from the SPEC website and  |
|              | save it under the yardstick/resources folder (e.g. /home/    |
|              | opnfv/repos/yardstick/yardstick/resources/cpu2006-1.2.iso)   |
|              | SPEC CPUÂ® 2006 benchmark is available for purchase via the   |
|              | SPEC order form (https://www.spec.org/order.html).           |
|              |                                                              |

|              |  * benchmark_subset - a subset of SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks   |
|              |    to run;                                                   |
|              |  * SPECint_benchmark - a SPECint benchmark to run;           |
|              |  * SPECint_benchmark - a SPECfp benchmark to run;            |
|              |  * output_format - desired report format;                    |
|              |  * runspec_config - SPEC CPU 2006 config file provided to    |
|              |    the runspec binary;                                       |

|              |    reportable run, must be either base or all. Reportable    |
|              |    runs do base first, then (optionally) peak;               |
|              |  * runspec_size - size of input data to run (test, train, or |
|              |    ref). Reportable runs ensure that your binaries can       |

|              | /cpu2006-1.2.iso). Additionally, to use your custom runspec  |
|              | config file you can save it under the yardstick/resources/   |
|              | files folder and specify the config file name in the         |
|              | runspec_config parameter.                                    |

|step 2        | Upload SPEC CPU 2006 ISO to the target VM using scp and      |
|              | install SPEC CPU 2006.                                       |

|              | yardstick to the target VM via the SSH tunnel.               |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 4        | SPEC CPU 2006 benchmark is invoked and SPEC CPU 2006 metrics |
|              | are generated.                                               |

|step 5        | Text, HTML, CSV, PDF, and Configuration file outputs for the |
|              | SPEC CPU 2006 metrics are fetched from the VM and stored     |
|              | under /tmp/result folder.                                    |
