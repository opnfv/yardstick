The project's goal is to verify infrastructure compliance, from the perspective
of a Virtual Network Function (VNF).

The Project's scope is the development of a test framework, *Yardstick*, test
cases and test stimuli to enable Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure
(NFVI) verification.

In OPNFV Brahmaputra release, generic test cases covering aspects of the
metrics in the document ETSI GS NFV-TST001_, "Pre-deployment Testing; Report on
Validation of NFV Environments and Services" are available; further OPNFV
releases will provide extended testing of these metrics.

*Yardstick* is used in OPNFV for verifying the OPNFV infrastructure and some of
the OPNFV features. The *Yardstick* framework is deployed in several OPNFV
community labs. It is *installer*, *infrastructure* and *application*
independent.
