|test purpose  | This test allows to measure performance of BNG network device|
|              | according to RFC2544 testing methodology. Test case creates  |
|              | PPPoE subscribers connections to BNG, run prioritized traffic|
|              | on maximum throughput on all ports and collects network      |
|              | and PPPoE subscribers metrics.                               |
|              |                                                              |

|              |  1. Create access network topologies (this topologies are    |
|              |     based on IXIA ports which are connected to BNG access    |
|              |     ports);                                                  |
|              |  2. Configure access network topologies with multiple device |
|              |     groups. Each device group represents single SVLAN with   |
|              |     PPPoE subscribers sessions (number of created on port    |
|              |     SVLANs and subscribers depends on specified if test case |
|              |     file options);                                           |
|              |  3. Create core network topologies (this topologies are      |
|              |     based on IXIA ports which are connected to BNG core      |
|              |     ports);                                                  |
|              |  4. Configure core network topologies with single device     |
|              |     group which represents one connection with configured    |
|              |     VLAN and BGP protocol;                                   |
|              |  5. Establish PPPoE subscribers connections to BNG;          |
|              |  6. Create traffic flows between access and core ports       |
|              |     (traffic flows are creating between access-core ports    |
|              |     pairs, traffic is bi-directional);                       |
|              |  7. Configure each traffic flow with specified in traffic    |
|              |     profile options;                                         |
|              |  8. Run traffic with specified in test case file duration;   |
|              |  9. Collect network metrics after traffic was stopped;       |
|              | 10. In case drop percentage rate is higher than expected,    |
|              |     reduce traffic line rate and repeat steps 7-10 again;    |
|              | 11. In case drop percentage rate is as expected or number    |
|              |     of maximum iterations in step 10 achieved, disconnect    |
|              |     PPPoE subscribers and stop traffic;                      |
|              | 12. Stop test.                                               |
|              |                                                              |

|step 3        | During test run, in the end of each iteration all specified  |
|              | in the document metrics are retrieved from IxNetwork and     |
|              | stored in the yardstick dispatcher.                          |
|              |                                                              |

|test verdict  | The test case aimed to do a performance testing of BNG with  |
|              | configured QoS settings according to RFC2544 methodology and |
|              | find maximum traffic line rate which BNG can handle with     |
|              | zero loss (or other non-zero allowed drop rate).             |
