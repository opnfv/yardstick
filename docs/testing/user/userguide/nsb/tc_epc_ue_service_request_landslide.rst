|test purpose  | The Spirent Landslide product provides one box solution which|
|              | allows to fully emulate all EPC network nodes including      |
|              | mobile users, network host and generate control and data     |
|              | plane traffic.                                               |
|              |                                                              |
|              | This test allows to check processing capabilities of EPC     |
|              | under high user connections rate and traffic load for case   |
|              | when UEs initiates service request (UE initiates bearer      |
|              | modification request to provide dedicated bearer for new     |
|              | type of traffic)                                             |
|              |                                                              |
|              | It's easy to replace emulated node or multiple nodes in test |
|              | topology with real node or corresponding vEPC VNF as DUT and |
|              | check it's processing capabilities under specific test case  |
|              | load conditions.                                             |
|              |                                                              |
