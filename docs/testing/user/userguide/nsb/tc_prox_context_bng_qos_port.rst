+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test purpose  | The BNG+QoS workload converts packets from QinQ to GRE       |
|              | tunnels, handles routing and adds/removes MPLS tags and      |
|              | performs a QoS.                                              |
|              | This use case simulates a realistic and complex application. |
|              | The number of users is 32K per port and the number of routes |
|              | is 8K.                                                       |
|              |                                                              |
|              | The BNG_QoS test cases are implemented to run in  baremetal  |
|              | and heat context an require 4 port topology to run the       |
|              | default configuration.                                       |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|configuration | The BNG_QoS test cases are listed below:                     |
|              |                                                              |

|              |                                                              |
|              | Test duration is set as 300sec for each test.                |
|              | The minumum packet size for BNG_QoS test is 78 bytes. This   |
|              | is set in the bng_qos traffic profile and can be configured  |
|              | to use a higher packet size for the test.                    |
|              |                                                              |

|              | PROX is a DPDK application that can simulate VNF workloads   |
|              | and can generate traffic and used for NFVI characterization  |

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|pre-test      | For Openstack test case image (yardstick-samplevnfs) needs   |
|conditions    | to be installed into Glance with Prox and Dpdk included in   |
|              | it. The test need multi-queue enabled in Glance image.       |
|              |                                                              |
|              | For Baremetal tests cases Prox and Dpdk must be installed in |
|              | the hosts where the test is executed. The pod.yaml file must |
|              | have the necessary system and NIC information                |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test sequence | description and expected result                              |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 1        | For Baremetal test: The TG and VNF are started on the hosts  |
|              | based on the pod file.                                       |
|              |                                                              |
|              | For Heat test: Two host VMs are booted, as Traffic generator |
|              | and VNF(BNG_QoS workload) based on the test flavor.          |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 2        | Yardstick is connected with the TG and VNF by using ssh.     |
|              | The test will resolve the topology and instantiate the VNF   |
|              | and TG and collect the KPI's/metrics.                        |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 3        | The TG will send packets to the VNF. If the number of        |
|              | dropped packets is more than the tolerated loss the line     |
|              | rate or throughput is halved. This is done until the dropped |
|              | packets are within an acceptable tolerated loss.             |
|              |                                                              |
|              | The KPI is the number of packets per second for 78 bytes     |
|              | packet size with an accepted minimal packet loss for the     |
|              | default configuration.                                       |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 4        | In Baremetal test: The test quits the application and unbind |
|              | the dpdk ports.                                              |
|              |                                                              |
|              | In Heat test: Two host VMs are deleted on test completion.   |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test verdict  | The test case will achieve a Throughput with an accepted     |
|              | minimal tolerated packet loss.                               |
