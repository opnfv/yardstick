|test purpose  | The Spirent Landslide product provides one box solution which|
|              | allows to fully emulate all EPC network nodes including      |
|              | mobile users, network host and generate control and data     |
|              | plane traffic.                                               |
|              |                                                              |
|              | This test allows to check processing capability of EPC under |
|              | different levels of load (number of subscriber, generated    |
|              | traffic throughput) for case when only one default bearer is |
|              | using for transferring traffic from UE to Network.           |
|              |                                                              |
|              | It's easy to replace emulated node or multiple nodes in test |
|              | topology with real node or corresponding vEPC VNF as DUT and |
|              | check it's processing capabilities under specific test case  |
|              | load conditions.                                             |
|              |                                                              |

|              | * Establish subscribers connections to EPC network (only     |
|              |   default bearers are established);                          |
|              | * Create the sessions and transmit traffic through EPC       |
|              |   network nodes during the specified traffic duration time;  |
