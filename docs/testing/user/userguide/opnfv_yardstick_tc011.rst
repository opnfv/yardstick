|test purpose  | The purpose of TC011 is to evaluate the IaaS network         |
|              | performance with regards to network jitter (packet delay     |
|              | variation).                                                  |
|              | It measures the packet delay variation sending the packets   |
|              | from one VM to the other.                                    |
|              |                                                              |
|              | The purpose is also to be able to spot the trends.           |
|              | Test results, graphs and similar shall be stored for         |
|              | comparison reasons and product evolution understanding       |
|              | between different OPNFV versions and/or configurations.      |
|              |                                                              |

|              | iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum      |
|              | achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of   |
|              | various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols. |
|              | The UDP protocols can be used to measure jitter delay.       |
|              |                                                              |
|              | (iperf3 is not always part of a Linux distribution, hence it |
|              | needs to be installed. It is part of the Yardstick Docker    |
|              | image. As an example see the /yardstick/tools/ directory for |
|              | how to generate a Linux image with pktgen included.)         |
|              |                                                              |

|description   |                                                              |
|              | Jitter calculations are continuously computed by the server, |
|              | as specified by RTP in RFC 1889. The client records a 64 bit |
|              | second/microsecond timestamp in the packet. The server       |
|              | computes the relative transit time as (server's receive time |
|              | - client's send time). The client's and server's clocks do   |
|              | not need to be synchronized; any difference is subtracted    |
|              | outin the jitter calculation. Jitter is the smoothed mean of |
|              | differences between consecutive transit times.               |
|              |                                                              |

|step 1        | Two host VMs with iperf3 installed are booted, as server and |
|              | client.                                                      |

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 2        | Yardstick is connected with the host VM by using ssh.        |
|              | A iperf3 server is started on the server VM via the ssh      |
|              | tunnel.                                                      |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 3        | iperf3 benchmark is invoked. Jitter is calculated and check  |
|              | against the SLA. Logs are produced and stored.               |
|              |                                                              |

|              |                                                              |

|              | value, or if there is a test case execution problem.         |
