   API
     Application Programming Interface

   Docker
     Docker provisions and manages containers. Yardstick and many other OPNFV
     projects are deployed in containers. Docker is required to launch the
     containerized versions of these projects.

   DPI
     Deep Packet Inspection

   DPDK
     Data Plane Development Kit

   DSCP
     Differentiated Services Code Point

   IGMP
     Internet Group Management Protocol

   IOPS
     Input/Output Operations Per Second
     A performance measurement used to benchmark storage devices.

   KPI
     Key Performance Indicator

   Kubernetes
     k8s
     Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating
     deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications.
     It is one of the contexts supported in Yardstick.

   NFV
     Network Function Virtualization
     NFV is an initiative to take network services which were traditionally run
     on proprietary, dedicated hardware, and virtualize them to run on general
     purpose hardware.

   NFVI
     Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure
     The servers, routers, switches, etc on which the NFV system runs.

   NIC
     Network Interface Controller

   OpenStack
      OpenStack is a cloud operating system that controls pools of compute,
      storage, and networking resources. OpenStack is an open source project
      licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

   PBFS
     Packet Based per Flow State

   PROX
     Packet pROcessing eXecution engine

   QoS
     Quality of Service
     The ability to guarantee certain network or storage requirements to
     satisfy a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between an application provider
     and end users.
     Typically includes performance requirements like networking bandwidth,
     latency, jitter correction, and reliability as well as storage
     performance in Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS), throttling
     agreements, and performance expectations at peak load

   SLA
     Service Level Agreement
     An SLA is an agreement between a service provider and a customer to
     provide a certain level of service/performance.

   SR-IOV
     Single Root IO Virtualization
     A specification that, when implemented by a physical PCIe
     device, enables it to appear as multiple separate PCIe devices. This
     enables multiple virtualized guests to share direct access to the
     physical device.

   SUT
     System Under Test

   ToS
     Type of Service

   VLAN
     Virtual LAN (Local Area Network)

   VM
     Virtual Machine
     An operating system instance that runs on top of a hypervisor.
     Multiple VMs can run at the same time on the same physical
     host.

   VNF
     Virtual Network Function

   VNFC
     Virtual Network Function Component
