===================================

Abstract

NSB test configuration and OpenStack setup requirements


OpenStack Network Configuration
-------------------------------

NSB requires certain OpenStack deployment configurations.
For optimal VNF characterization using external traffic generators NSB requires
provider/external networks.


Provider networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The VNFs require a clear L2 connect to the external network in order to
generate realistic traffic from multiple address ranges and ports.

In order to prevent Neutron from filtering traffic we have to disable Neutron
Port Security. We also disable DHCP on the data ports because we are binding
the ports to DPDK and do not need DHCP addresses.  We also disable gateways
because multiple default gateways can prevent SSH access to the VNF from the
floating IP.  We only want a gateway on the mgmt network

.. code-block:: yaml

    uplink_0:
      cidr: '10.1.0.0/24'
      gateway_ip: 'null'
      port_security_enabled: False
      enable_dhcp: 'false'

Heat Topologies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default Heat will attach every node to every Neutron network that is
created. For scale-out tests we do not want to attach every node to every
network.

For each node you can specify which ports are on which network using the
network_ports dictionary.

In this example we have ``TRex xe0 <-> xe0 VNF xe1 <-> xe0 UDP_Replay``

.. code-block:: yaml

      vnf_0:
        floating_ip: true
        placement: "pgrp1"
        network_ports:
          mgmt:
            - mgmt
          uplink_0:
            - xe0
          downlink_0:
            - xe1
      tg_0:
        floating_ip: true
        placement: "pgrp1"
        network_ports:
          mgmt:
            - mgmt
          uplink_0:
            - xe0
          # Trex always needs two ports
          uplink_1:
            - xe1
      tg_1:
        floating_ip: true
        placement: "pgrp1"
        network_ports:
          mgmt:
           - mgmt
          downlink_0:
           - xe0


Availability zone
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The configuration of the availability zone is requred in cases where location
of exact compute host/group of compute hosts needs to be specified for SampleVNF
or traffic generator in the heat test case. If this is the case, please follow
the instructions below.

.. _`Create a host aggregate`:

1. Create a host aggregate in the OpenStack and add the available compute hosts
   into the aggregate group.

   .. note:: Change the ``<AZ_NAME>`` (availability zone name), ``<AGG_NAME>``
     (host aggregate name) and ``<HOST>`` (host name of one of the compute) in the
     commands below.

   .. code-block:: bash

     # create host aggregate
     openstack aggregate create --zone <AZ_NAME> --property availability_zone=<AZ_NAME> <AGG_NAME>
     # show available hosts
     openstack compute service list --service nova-compute
     # add selected host into the host aggregate
     openstack aggregate add host <AGG_NAME> <HOST>

2. To specify the OpenStack location (the exact compute host or group of the hosts)
   of SampleVNF or traffic generator in the heat test case, the ``availability_zone`` server
   configuration option should be used. For example:

   .. note:: The ``<AZ_NAME>`` (availability zone name) should be changed according
     to the name used during the host aggregate creation steps above.

   .. code-block:: yaml

     context:
       name: yardstick
       image: yardstick-samplevnfs
       ...
       servers:
         vnf__0:
           ...
           availability_zone: <AZ_NAME>
           ...
         tg__0:
           ...
           availability_zone: <AZ_NAME>
           ...
       networks:
         ...

There are two example of SampleVNF scale out test case which use the availability zone
feature to specify the exact location of scaled VNFs and traffic generators.

Those are:

.. code-block:: console

  <repo>/samples/vnf_samples/nsut/prox/tc_prox_heat_context_l2fwd_multiflow-2-scale-out.yaml
  <repo>/samples/vnf_samples/nsut/vfw/tc_heat_rfc2544_ipv4_1rule_1flow_64B_trex_scale_out.yaml

.. note:: This section describes the PROX scale-out testcase, but the same
  procedure is used for the vFW test case.

1. Before running the scale-out test case, make sure the host aggregates are
   configured in the OpenStack environment. To check this, run the following
   command:

   .. code-block:: console

     # show configured host aggregates (example)
     openstack aggregate list
     +----+------+-------------------+
     | ID | Name | Availability Zone |
     +----+------+-------------------+
     |  4 | agg0 | AZ_NAME_0         |
     |  5 | agg1 | AZ_NAME_1         |
     +----+------+-------------------+

2. If no host aggregates are configured, please use `steps above`__ to
   configure them.

__ `Create a host aggregate`_


3. Run the SampleVNF PROX scale-out test case, specifying the availability
   zone of each VNF and traffic generator as a task arguments.

   .. note:: The ``az_0`` and ``az_1`` should be changed according to the host
     aggregates created in the OpenStack.

   .. code-block:: console

     yardstick -d task start\
     <repo>/samples/vnf_samples/nsut/prox/tc_prox_heat_context_l2fwd_multiflow-2-scale-out.yaml\
       --task-args='{
         "num_vnfs": 4, "availability_zone": {
           "vnf_0": "az_0", "tg_0": "az_1",
           "vnf_1": "az_0", "tg_1": "az_1",
           "vnf_2": "az_0", "tg_2": "az_1",
           "vnf_3": "az_0", "tg_3": "az_1"
         }
       }'

   ``num_vnfs`` specifies how many VNFs are going to be deployed in the
   ``heat`` contexts. ``vnf_X`` and ``tg_X`` arguments configure the
   availability zone where the VNF and traffic generator is going to be deployed.


Collectd KPIs
-------------

NSB can collect KPIs from collected.  We have support for various plugins
enabled by the Barometer project.

The default yardstick-samplevnf has collectd installed. This allows for
collecting KPIs from the VNF.

Collecting KPIs from the NFVi is more complicated and requires manual setup.
We assume that collectd is not installed on the compute nodes.

To collectd KPIs from the NFVi compute nodes:


    * install_collectd on the compute nodes
    * create pod.yaml for the compute nodes
    * enable specific plugins depending on the vswitch and DPDK

    example pod.yaml section for Compute node running collectd.

.. code-block:: yaml

    -
      name: "compute-1"
      role: Compute
      ip: "10.1.2.3"
      user: "root"
      ssh_port: "22"
      password: ""
      collectd:
        interval: 5
        plugins:
          # for libvirtd stats
          virt: {}
          intel_pmu: {}
          ovs_stats:
            # path to OVS socket
            ovs_socket_path: /var/run/openvswitch/db.sock
          intel_rdt: {}



Scale-Up
--------

VNFs performance data with scale-up

  * Helps to figure out optimal number of cores specification in the Virtual
    Machine template creation or VNF
  * Helps in comparison between different VNF vendor offerings
  * Better the scale-up index, indicates the performance scalability of a
    particular solution

Heat
^^^^
For VNF scale-up tests we increase the number for VNF worker threads.  In the
case of VNFs we also need to increase the number of VCPUs and memory allocated
to the VNF.

An example scale-up Heat testcase is:

.. literalinclude:: /submodules/yardstick/samples/vnf_samples/nsut/vfw/tc_heat_rfc2544_ipv4_1rule_1flow_64B_trex_scale-up.yaml
   :language: yaml

This testcase template requires specifying the number of VCPUs, Memory and Ports.
We set the VCPUs and memory using the ``--task-args`` options

.. code-block:: console

  yardstick task start --task-args='{"mem": 10480, "vcpus": 4, "vports": 2}' \
  samples/vnf_samples/nsut/vfw/tc_heat_rfc2544_ipv4_1rule_1flow_64B_trex_scale-up.yaml

In order to support ports scale-up, traffic and topology templates need to be used in testcase.

A example topology template is:

.. literalinclude:: /submodules/yardstick/samples/vnf_samples/nsut/vfw/vfw-tg-topology-scale-up.yaml
   :language: yaml

This template has ``vports`` as an argument. To pass this argument it needs to
be configured in ``extra_args`` scenario definition. Please note that more
argument can be defined in that section. All of them will be passed to topology
and traffic profile templates

For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   schema: yardstick:task:0.1
   scenarios:
   - type: NSPerf
     traffic_profile: ../../traffic_profiles/ipv4_throughput-scale-up.yaml
     extra_args:
       vports: {{ vports }}
     topology: vfw-tg-topology-scale-up.yaml

A example traffic profile template is:

.. literalinclude:: /submodules/yardstick/samples/vnf_samples/traffic_profiles/ipv4_throughput-scale-up.yaml
   :language: yaml

There is an option to provide predefined config for SampleVNFs. Path to config
file may by specified in ``vnf_config`` scenario section.

.. code-block:: yaml

   vnf__0:
      rules: acl_1rule.yaml
      vnf_config: {lb_config: 'SW', file: vfw_vnf_pipeline_cores_4_ports_2_lb_1_sw.conf }


Baremetal
^^^^^^^^^
  1. Follow above traffic generator section to setup.
  2. Edit num of threads in
     ``<repo>/samples/vnf_samples/nsut/vfw/tc_baremetal_rfc2544_ipv4_1rule_1flow_64B_trex_scale_up.yaml``
     e.g, 6 Threads for given VNF

.. code-block:: yaml


     schema: yardstick:task:0.1
     scenarios:
     {% for worker_thread in [1, 2 ,3 , 4, 5, 6] %}
     - type: NSPerf
       traffic_profile: ../../traffic_profiles/ipv4_throughput.yaml
       topology: vfw-tg-topology.yaml
       nodes:
         tg__0: trafficgen_1.yardstick
         vnf__0: vnf.yardstick
       options:
         framesize:
           uplink: {64B: 100}
           downlink: {64B: 100}
         flow:
           src_ip: [{'tg__0': 'xe0'}]
           dst_ip: [{'tg__0': 'xe1'}]
           count: 1
         traffic_type: 4
         rfc2544:
           allowed_drop_rate: 0.0001 - 0.0001
         vnf__0:
           rules: acl_1rule.yaml
           vnf_config: {lb_config: 'HW', lb_count: 1, worker_config: '1C/1T', worker_threads: {{worker_thread}}}
           nfvi_enable: True
       runner:
         type: Iteration
         iterations: 10
         interval: 35
     {% endfor %}
     context:
       type: Node
       name: yardstick
       nfvi_type: baremetal
       file: /etc/yardstick/nodes/pod.yaml

Scale-Out
---------

VNFs performance data with scale-out helps

  * in capacity planning to meet the given network node requirements
  * in comparison between different VNF vendor offerings
  * better the scale-out index, provides the flexibility in meeting future
    capacity requirements


Standalone
^^^^^^^^^^

Scale-out not supported on Baremetal.

1. Follow above traffic generator section to setup.
2. Generate testcase for standalone virtualization using ansible scripts

  .. code-block:: console

    cd <repo>/ansible
    trex: standalone_ovs_scale_out_trex_test.yaml or standalone_sriov_scale_out_trex_test.yaml
    ixia: standalone_ovs_scale_out_ixia_test.yaml or standalone_sriov_scale_out_ixia_test.yaml
    ixia_correlated: standalone_ovs_scale_out_ixia_correlated_test.yaml or standalone_sriov_scale_out_ixia_correlated_test.yaml

  update the ovs_dpdk or sriov above Ansible scripts reflect the setup

3. run the test

  .. code-block:: console

    <repo>/samples/vnf_samples/nsut/tc_sriov_vfw_udp_ixia_correlated_scale_out-1.yaml
    <repo>/samples/vnf_samples/nsut/tc_sriov_vfw_udp_ixia_correlated_scale_out-2.yaml

Heat
^^^^

There are sample scale-out all-VM Heat tests. These tests only use VMs and
don't use external traffic.

The tests use UDP_Replay and correlated traffic.

.. code-block:: console

  <repo>/samples/vnf_samples/nsut/cgnapt/tc_heat_rfc2544_ipv4_1flow_64B_trex_correlated_scale_4.yaml

To run the test you need to increase OpenStack CPU, Memory and Port quotas.


Traffic Generator tuning
------------------------

The TRex traffic generator can be setup to use multiple threads per core, this
is for multiqueue testing.

TRex does not automatically enable multiple threads because we currently cannot
detect the number of queues on a device.

To enable multiple queue set the ``queues_per_port`` value in the TG VNF
options section.

.. code-block:: yaml

  scenarios:
    - type: NSPerf
      nodes:
        tg__0: tg_0.yardstick

      options:
        tg_0:
          queues_per_port: 2


Standalone configuration
------------------------

NSB supports certain Standalone deployment configurations.
Standalone supports provisioning a VM in a standalone visualised environment using kvm/qemu.
There two types of Standalone contexts available: OVS-DPDK and SRIOV.
OVS-DPDK uses OVS network with DPDK drivers.
SRIOV enables network traffic to bypass the software switch layer of the Hyper-V stack.

Standalone with OVS-DPDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SampleVNF image is spawned in a VM on a baremetal server.
OVS with DPDK is installed on the baremetal server.

.. note:: Ubuntu 17.10 requires DPDK v.17.05 and higher, DPDK v.17.05 requires OVS v.2.8.0.

Default values for OVS-DPDK:

  * queues: 4
  * lcore_mask: ""
  * pmd_cpu_mask: "0x6"

Sample test case file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  1. Prepare SampleVNF image and copy it to ``flavor/images``.
  2. Prepare context files for TREX and SampleVNF under ``contexts/file``.
  3. Add bridge named ``br-int`` to the baremetal where SampleVNF image is deployed.
  4. Modify ``networks/phy_port`` accordingly to the baremetal setup.
  5. Run test from:

.. literalinclude:: /submodules/yardstick/samples/vnf_samples/nsut/acl/tc_ovs_rfc2544_ipv4_1rule_1flow_64B_trex.yaml
   :language: yaml
