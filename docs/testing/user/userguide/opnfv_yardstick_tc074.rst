|test purpose  | To evaluate and report on the Cinder volume performance.     |
|              |                                                              |
|              | This testcase integrates with OPNFV StorPerf to measure      |
|              | block performance of the underlying Cinder drivers.  Many    |
|              | options are supported, and even the root disk (Glance        |
|              | ephemeral storage can be profiled.                           |
|              |                                                              |
|              | The fundamental concept of the test case is to first fill    |
|              | the volumes with random data to ensure reported metrics      |
|              | are indicative of continued usage and not skewed by          |
|              | transitional performance while the underlying storage        |
|              | driver allocates blocks.                                     |
|              | The metrics for filling the volumes with random data         |
|              | are not reported in the final results.  The test also        |
|              | ensures the volumes are performing at a consistent level     |
|              | of performance by measuring metrics every minute, and        |
|              | comparing the trend of the metrics over the run.  By         |
|              | evaluating the min and max values, as well as the slope of   |
|              | the trend, it can make the determination that the metrics    |
|              | are stable, and not fluctuating beyond industry standard     |
|              | norms.                                                       |

|              |   will be used to execute the performance test. In the case  |
|              |   of a device, the entire device will be used. If not        |

|              |   If not specified, the default is to run all workloads. The |
|              |   workload types are:                                        |
|              |      - rs: 100% Read, sequential data                        |
|              |      - ws: 100% Write, sequential data                       |
|              |      - rr: 100% Read, random access                          |

|              |   measurements.                                              |
|              | * workloads={json maps}                                      |
|              |   This parameter supercedes the workload and calls the V2.0  |
|              |   API in StorPerf. It allows for greater control of the      |
|              |   parameters to be passed to FIO.  For example, running a    |
|              |   random read/write with a mix of 90% read and 10% write     |
|              |   would be expressed as follows:                             |
|              |   {"9010randrw": {"rw":"randrw","rwmixread": "90"}}          |
|              |   Note: This must be passed in as a string, so don't forget  |
|              |   to escape or otherwise properly deal with the quotes.      |
|              |                                                              |
|              | * report= [job_id]                                           |
|              |   Query the status of the supplied job_id and report on      |
|              |   metrics. If a workload is supplied, will report on only    |
|              |   that subset.                                               |
|              |                                                              |
|              |   There are default values for each above-mentioned option.  |
|              |                                                              |
