Installation
==============

Yardstick currently supports installation on Ubuntu 14.04 or by using a Docker
image. Detailed steps about installing Yardstick using both of these options
can be found below.

To use Yardstick you should have access to an OpenStack environment,
with at least Nova, Neutron, Glance, Keystone and Heat installed.

The steps needed to run Yardstick are:

1. Install Yardstick and create the test configuration .yaml file.
2. Build guest image and load the image into the OpenStack environment.
3. Run the test case.

Installing Yardstick on Ubuntu 14.04
------------------------------------

Installing Yardstick framework
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install dependencies:
::

  sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python-dev
  sudo apt-get install libffi-dev libssl-dev git
  sudo easy_install -U setuptools


Create a python virtual environment and source it:
::

  virtualenv ~/yardstick_venv
  source ~/yardstick_venv/bin/activate


Download source code and install python dependencies:
::

  git clone https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/yardstick
  cd yardstick
  python setup.py install


There is also a YouTube video, showing the above steps:

Installing extra tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
yardstick-plot
""""""""""""""
Yardstick has an internal plotting tool `yardstick-plot`, which can be installed
using the following command:
::

  python setup.py develop easy_install yardstick[plot]

Building a guest image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Yardstick has a tool for building an Ubuntu Cloud Server image containing all
the required tools to run Yardstick supported test cases.
It is necessary to have sudo rights to use this tool.

This image can be built using the following command while in the directory where
Yardstick is installed (``~/yardstick`` if the framework is installed
by following the commands above):
::

  sudo ./tools/yardstick-img-modify tools/ubuntu-server-cloudimg-modify.sh

**Warning:** the script will create files by default in:
``/tmp/workspace/yardstick`` and the files will be owned by root!

The created image can be added to OpenStack using the ``glance image-create`` or
via the OpenStack Dashboard.

Example command:
::

  glance image-create --name yardstick-trusty-server --is-public true \
  --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare \
  --file /tmp/workspace/yardstick/yardstick-trusty-server.img

Yardstick-flavor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Most of the sample test cases in Yardstick are using a OpenStack flavor called
*yardstick-flavor* which deviates from the OpenStack standard m1.tiny flavor by the
disk size - instead of 1GB it has 3GB. Other parameters are the same as in m1.timy.

Installing Yardstick using Docker
---------------------------------

Pull the Yardstick Docker image from Docker hub:

::

  docker pull opnfv/yardstick-ci

Run the docker image:

::

  docker run \
   --privileged=true \
    --rm \
    -t \
    -e "INSTALLER_TYPE=${INSTALLER_TYPE}" \
    -e "INSTALLER_IP=${INSTALLER_IP}" \
    opnfv/yardstick-ci \
    run_benchmarks

Where ``${INSTALLER_TYPE}`` can be fuel, foreman or compass and ``${INSTALLER_IP}``
is the installer master node ip address (i.e. 10.20.0.2 is default for fuel).

Basic steps performed by the container:

1. clone yardstick and releng repos
2. setup OS credentials (releng scripts)
3. install yardstick and dependencies
4. build yardstick cloud image and upload it to glance
5. upload cirros-0.3.3 cloud image to glance
6. run yardstick test scenarios
7. cleanup


Examples and verifying the install
----------------------------------

It is recommended to verify that Yardstick was installed successfully
by executing some simple commands and test samples. Below is an example invocation
of yardstick help command and ping.py test sample:
::

  yardstick â€“h
  yardstick task start samples/ping.yaml

Each testing tool supported by Yardstick has a sample configuration file.
These configuration files can be found in the **samples** directory.

Default location for the output is ``/tmp/yardstick.out``.

Example invocation of ``yardstick-plot`` tool:
::

  yardstick-plot -i /tmp/yardstick.out -o /tmp/plots/

More info about the tool can be found by executing:
::

  yardstick-plot -h
