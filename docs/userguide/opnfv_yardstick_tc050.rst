|OpenStack Controller Node Network High Availability                          |
|                                                                             |

|test case id  | OPNFV_YARDSTICK_TC050: OpenStack Controller Node Network     |
|              | High Availability                                            |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test purpose  | This test case will verify the high availability of control  |
|              | node. When one of the controller failed to connect the       |
|              | network, which breaks down the Openstack services on this    |
|              | node. These Openstack service should able to be accessed by  |
|              | other controller nodes, and the services on failed           |
|              | controller node should be isolated.                          |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test method   | This test case turns off the network interfaces of a         |
|              | specified control node, then checks whether all services     |
|              | provided by the control node are OK with some monitor tools. |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|attackers     | In this test case, an attacker called "close-interface" is   |
|              | needed. This attacker includes three parameters:             |
|              | 1) fault_type: which is used for finding the attacker's      |
|              | scripts. It should be always set to "close-interface" in     |
|              | this test case.                                              |
|              | 2) host: which is the name of a control node being attacked. |
|              | 3) interface: the network interface to be turned off.        |
|              |                                                              |
|              | There are four instance of the "close-interface" monitor:    |
|              | attacker1(for public netork):                                |
|              | -fault_type: "close-interface"                               |
|              | -host: node1                                                 |
|              | -interface: "br-ex"                                          |
|              | attacker2(for management netork):                            |
|              | -fault_type: "close-interface"                               |
|              | -host: node1                                                 |
|              | -interface: "br-mgmt"                                        |
|              | attacker3(for storage netork):                               |
|              | -fault_type: "close-interface"                               |
|              | -host: node1                                                 |
|              | -interface: "br-storage"                                     |
|              | attacker4(for private netork):                               |
|              | -fault_type: "close-interface"                               |
|              | -host: node1                                                 |
|              | -interface: "br-mesh"                                        |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|monitors      | In this test case, the monitor named "openstack-cmd" is      |
|              | needed. The monitor needs needs two parameters:              |
|              | 1) monitor_type: which is used for finding the monitor class |
|              | and related scritps. It should be always set to              |
|              | "openstack-cmd" for this monitor.                            |
|              | 2) command_name: which is the command name used for request  |
|              |                                                              |
|              | There are four instance of the "openstack-cmd" monitor:      |
|              | monitor1:                                                    |
|              | -monitor_type: "openstack-cmd"                               |
|              | -command_name: "nova image-list"                             |
|              | monitor2:                                                    |
|              | -monitor_type: "openstack-cmd"                               |
|              | -command_name: "neutron router-list"                         |
|              | monitor3:                                                    |
|              | -monitor_type: "openstack-cmd"                               |
|              | -command_name: "heat stack-list"                             |
|              | monitor4:                                                    |
|              | -monitor_type: "openstack-cmd"                               |
|              | -command_name: "cinder list"                                 |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|metrics       | In this test case, there is one metric:                      |
|              | 1)service_outage_time: which indicates the maximum outage    |
|              | time (seconds) of the specified Openstack command request.   |

|              | each monitor will run with independently process             |

|step 2        | do attacker: connect the host through SSH, and then execute  |
|              | the turnoff network interface script with param value        |
|              | specified by  "interface".                                   |

|post-action   | It is the action when the test cases exist. It turns up the  |
|              | network interface of the control node if it is not turned    |
|              | up.                                                          |
