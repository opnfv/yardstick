Yardstick_ is an OPNFV Project.

The project's goal is to verify infrastructure compliance, from the perspective
of a Virtual Network Function (:term:`VNF`).

The Project's scope is the development of a test framework, *Yardstick*, test
cases and test stimuli to enable Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure
(:term:`NFVI`) verification.
The Project also includes a sample :term:`VNF`, the Virtual Traffic Classifier
(:term:`VTC`)  and its experimental framework, *ApexLake* !

*Yardstick* is used in OPNFV for verifying the OPNFV infrastructure and some of
the OPNFV features. The *Yardstick* framework is deployed in several OPNFV
community labs. It is *installer*, *infrastructure* and *application*
independent.

   Presentation_ for an overview of *Yardstick*
