|test purpose  | The purpose of TC005 is to evaluate the IaaS storage         |
|              | performance with regards to IOPS, throughput and latency.    |
|              |                                                              |
|              | The purpose is also to be able to spot the trends.           |
|              | Test results, graphs and similar shall be stored for         |
|              | comparison reasons and product evolution understanding       |
|              | between different OPNFV versions and/or configurations.      |

|              | fio is an I/O tool meant to be used both for benchmark and   |
|              | stress/hardware verification. It has support for 19          |
|              | different types of I/O engines (sync, mmap, libaio,          |
|              | posixaio, SG v3, splice, null, network, syslet, guasi,       |
|              | solarisaio, and more), I/O priorities (for newer Linux       |
|              | kernels), rate I/O, forked or threaded jobs, and much more.  |
|              |                                                              |
|              | (fio is not always part of a Linux distribution, hence it    |
|              | needs to be installed. As an example see the                 |

|              | image with fio included.)                                    |

|applicability | This test case can be configured with different:             |
|              |                                                              |
|              |   * IO types;                                                |
|              |   * IO block size;                                           |
|              |   * IO depth;                                                |
|              |   * ramp time;                                               |
|              |   * test duration.                                           |
|              |                                                              |
|              | Default values exist.                                        |
|              |                                                              |
|              | SLA is optional. The SLA in this test case serves as an      |
|              | example. Considerably higher throughput and lower latency    |
|              | are expected. However, to cover most configurations, both    |
|              | baremetal and fully virtualized  ones, this value should be  |
|              | possible to achieve and acceptable for black box testing.    |
|              | Many heavy IO applications start to suffer badly if the      |
|              | read/write bandwidths are lower than this.                   |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|usability     | This test case is one of Yardstick's generic test. Thus it   |
|              | is runnable on most of the scenarios.                        |
|              |                                                              |

|pre-test      | The test case image needs to be installed into Glance        |
|conditions    | with fio included in it.                                     |
|              |                                                              |

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 1        | A host VM with fio installed is booted.                      |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 2        | Yardstick is connected with the host VM by using ssh.        |
|              | 'fio_benchmark' bash script is copyied from Jump Host to     |
|              | the host VM via the ssh tunnel.                              |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 3        | 'fio_benchmark' script is invoked. Simulated IO operations   |
|              | are started. IOPS, disk read/write bandwidth and latency are |
|              | recorded and checked against the SLA. Logs are produced and  |
|              | stored.                                                      |
|              |                                                              |
|              | Result: Logs are stored.                                     |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 4        | The host VM is deleted.                                      |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test verdict  | Fails only if SLA is not passed, or if there is a test case  |
|              | execution problem.                                           |
|              |                                                              |
