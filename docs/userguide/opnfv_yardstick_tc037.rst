|metric        | Number of flows, latency, throughput, CPU load, packet loss  |
|              |                                                              |

|test purpose  | To evaluate the IaaS network performance with regards to     |
|              | flows and throughput, such as if and how different amounts   |
|              | of flows matter for the throughput between hosts on different|
|              | compute blades. Typically e.g. the performance of a vSwitch  |
|              | depends on the number of flows running through it. Also      |
|              | performance of other equipment or entities can depend        |
|              | on the number of flows or the packet sizes used.             |
|              | The purpose is also to be able to spot trends. Test results, |
|              | graphs ans similar shall be stored for comparison reasons and|
|              | product evolution understanding between different OPNFV      |
|              | versions and/or configurations.                              |

|              | Packet size: 64 bytes                                        |
|              | Number of ports: 1, 10, 50, 100, 300, 500, 750 and 1000.     |
|              | The amount configured ports map from 2 up to 1001000 flows,  |
|              | respectively. Each port amount is run two times, for 20      |
|              | seconds each. Then the next port_amount is run, and so on.   |
|              | During the test CPU load on both client and server, and the  |
|              | network latency between the client and server are measured.  |
|              | The client and server are distributed on different HW.       |
|              | For SLA max_ppm is set to 1000.                              |
