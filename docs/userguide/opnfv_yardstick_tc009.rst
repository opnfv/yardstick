|test purpose  | To evaluate the IaaS network performance with regards to     |
|              | flows and throughput, such as if and how different amounts   |
|              | of flows matter for the throughput between VMs on different  |
|              | compute blades.                                              |
|              | Typically e.g. the performance of a vSwitch                  |
|              | depends on the number of flows running through it. Also      |
|              | performance of other equipment or entities can depend        |
|              | on the number of flows or the packet sizes used.             |
|              | The purpose is also to be able to spot trends. Test results, |
|              | graphs ans similar shall be stored for comparison reasons and|
|              | product evolution understanding between different OPNFV      |
|              | versions and/or configurations.                              |

|              | respectively. Each port amount is run ten times, for 20      |
|              | seconds each. Then the next port_amount is run, and so on.   |
|              |                                                              |

|pre-test      | The test case image needs to be installed into Glance        |

|step 1        | The hosts are installed, as server and client. pktgen is     |
|              | invoked and logs are produced  and stored.                   |
