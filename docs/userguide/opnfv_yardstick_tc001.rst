|test purpose  | The purpose of TC001 is to evaluate the IaaS network         |
|              | performance with regards to flows and throughput, such as if |
|              | and how different amounts of flows matter for the throughput |
|              | between hosts on different compute blades. Typically e.g.    |
|              | the performance of a vSwitch depends on the number of flows  |
|              | running through it. Also performance of other equipment or   |
|              | entities can depend on the number of flows or the packet     |
|              | sizes used.                                                  |
|              |                                                              |
|              | The purpose is also to be able to spot the trends.           |
|              | Test results, graphs and similar shall be stored for         |
|              | comparison reasons and product evolution understanding       |
|              | between different OPNFV versions and/or configurations.      |
|              |                                                              |

|test tool     | pktgen                                                       |
|              |                                                              |
|              | Linux packet generator is a tool to generate packets at very |
|              | high speed in the kernel. pktgen is mainly used to drive and |
|              | LAN equipment test network. pktgen supports multi threading. |
|              | To generate random MAC address, IP address, port number UDP  |
|              | packets, pktgen uses multiple CPU processors in the          |
|              | different PCI bus (PCI, PCIe bus) with Gigabit Ethernet      |
|              | tested (pktgen performance depends on the CPU processing     |
|              | speed, memory delay, PCI bus speed hardware parameters),     |
|              | Transmit data rate can be even larger than 10GBit/s. Visible |
|              | can satisfy most card test requirements.                     |
|              |                                                              |
|              | (Pktgen is not always part of a Linux distribution, hence it |
|              | needs to be installed. It is part of the Yardstick Docker    |
|              | image.                                                       |
|              | As an example see the /yardstick/tools/ directory for how    |
|              | to generate a Linux image with pktgen included.)             |

|step 1        | Two host VMs are booted, as server and client.               |

|step 2        | Yardstick is connected with the server VM by using ssh.      |
|              | 'pktgen_benchmark' bash script is copyied from Jump Host to  |
|              | the server VM via the ssh tunnel.                            |

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 4        | pktgen is invoked to generate packet flow between two server |
|              | and client for simulating network workloads on the SUT.      |
|              | Results are processed and checked against the SLA. Logs are  |

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|step 5        | Two host VMs are deleted.                                    |

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test verdict  | Fails only if SLA is not passed, or if there is a test case  |
|              | execution problem.                                           |
|              |                                                              |
