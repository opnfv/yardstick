|OpenStack Controller Load Balance Service High Availability                  |
|                                                                             |

|test case id  | OPNFV_YARDSTICK_TC053: OpenStack Controller Load Balance     |
|              | Service High Availability-                                   |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test purpose  | This test case will verify the high availability of the      |
|              | load balance service(current is HAProxy) that supports       |
|              | OpenStack on controller node. When the load balance service  |
|              | of a specified controller node is killed, whether other load |
|              | balancers on other controller nodes will work, and whether   |
|              | the controller node will restart the load balancer are       |
|              | checked.                                                     |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|test method   | This test case kills the processes of load balance service   |
|              | on a selected control node, then checks whether the request  |
|              | of the related Openstack command is OK and the killed        |
|              | processes are recovered.                                     |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|attackers     | In this test case, an attacker called "kill-process" is      |
|              | needed. This attacker includes three parameters:             |
|              | 1) fault_type: which is used for finding the attacker's      |
|              | scripts. It should be always set to "kill-process" in this   |
|              | test case.                                                   |
|              | 2) process_name: which is the process name of the specified  |
|              | OpenStack service. If there are multiple processes use the   |
|              | same name on the host, all of them are killed by this        |
|              | attacker.                                                    |
|              | In this case. This parameter should always set to "swift-    |
|              | proxy".                                                      |
|              | 3) host: which is the name of a control node being attacked. |
|              |                                                              |
|              | e.g.                                                         |
|              | -fault_type: "kill-process"                                  |
|              | -process_name: "haproxy"                                     |
|              | -host: node1                                                 |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|monitors      | In this test case, two kinds of monitor are needed:          |
|              | 1. the "openstack-cmd" monitor constantly request a specific |
|              | Openstack command, which needs two parameters:               |
|              | 1) monitor_type: which is used for finding the monitor class |
|              | and related scritps. It should be always set to              |
|              | "openstack-cmd" for this monitor.                            |
|              | 2) command_name: which is the command name used for request. |
|              |                                                              |
|              | 2. the "process" monitor check whether a process is running  |
|              | on a specific node, which needs three parameters:            |
|              | 1) monitor_type: which used for finding the monitor class    |
|              | and related scripts. It should be always set to "process"    |
|              | for this monitor.                                            |
|              | 2) process_name: which is the process name for monitor       |
|              | 3) host: which is the name of the node runing the process    |
|              | In this case, the command_name of monitor1 should be         |
|              | services that is supported by load balancer and the process- |
|              | name of monitor2 should be "haproxy", for example:           |
|              |                                                              |
|              | e.g.                                                         |
|              | monitor1:                                                    |
|              | -monitor_type: "openstack-cmd"                               |
|              | -command_name: "nova image-list"                             |
|              | monitor2:                                                    |
|              | -monitor_type: "process"                                     |
|              | -process_name: "haproxy"                                     |
|              | -host: node1                                                 |
|              |                                                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
|metrics       | In this test case, there are two metrics:                    |
|              | 1)service_outage_time: which indicates the maximum outage    |
|              | time (seconds) of the specified Openstack command request.   |
|              | 2)process_recover_time: which indicates the maximun time     |
|              | (seconds) from the process being killed to recovered         |
|              |                                                              |

|configuration | This test case needs two configuration files:                |
|              | 1) test case file: opnfv_yardstick_tc053.yaml                |

|post-action   | It is the action when the test cases exist. It will check    |
|              | the status of the specified process on the host, and restart |
|              | the process if it is not running for next test cases.        |
