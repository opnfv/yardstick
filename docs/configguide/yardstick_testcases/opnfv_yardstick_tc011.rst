|              | iPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum      |
|              | achievable bandwidth on IP networks. It supports tuning of   |
|              | various parameters related to timing, buffers and protocols. |
|              | The UDP protocols can be used to measure jitter delay.       |
